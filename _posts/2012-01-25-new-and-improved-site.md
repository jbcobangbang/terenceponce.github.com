After so long, I finally got around to using GitHub pages to make my website. I merged all of my relevant articles from my old blogs into this website's blog, so I could document my posts and progress more accurately.

This website was built using Jekyll, Disqus, and Twitter Bootstrap. Yes, the website looks like crap, but considering that I can't design webpages for my life, this is actually pretty decent. I also like a minimalist look to my website.

Since this site and its code is hosted on GitHub, this is probably going to be my permanent space now. There's still a lot of things that needs to be added and fixed in this site, but I can officially declare this site as live. Look forward to more content in the future.
