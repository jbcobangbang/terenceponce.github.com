I decided to start learning Python recently. I figured I should try learning something new outside the C-family of languages (C, C++, Java, C#, etc) just for kicks. Python seems like the perfect language to make that transition that I want since it is somewhere between C and non-C in terms of syntax.

Since I have no idea how to start learning Python, I decided to ask [a question](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/12189/500) on [Programmers on Stack Exchange](http://programmers.stackexchange.com), which is a Q&A site that I visit most of the time. I also tried searching the net for good books about learning how to code in Python. The best one I found was a book called [Dive Into Python](http://diveintopython.org), which is for experienced programmers who are new to Python. I thought it was perfect for me because I don't want to have to read about stuff I know already.

After following the [setup guide](http://diveintopython.org/installing_python/index.html) for Python development and reading some of the first few pages of the book, I immediately tried writing a 'Hello World' program. I couldn't believe how short the code was. It only took one line to write a Python application that outputs "Hello World" on the console window.

{% highlight python tabsize=2 %}
print "Hello World"
{% endhighlight %}

If you came from a C-language background, you'll know how I feel right about now because you have to write a decent amount of code to output the same thing on the console window if you used C-like languages. As I write this post, I still can't get over the fact about how ridiculously short a 'Hello World' application in Python is.

Another thing that I like about Python right now is how its syntax is very close to the English language. I'm pretty sure we'll get along just fine because I value syntax readability a lot.
