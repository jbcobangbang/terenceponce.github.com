<h3>Who am I?</h1>
<p>I'm Terence Ponce. I am a software developer based in Manila, Philippines. I started out on my professional career in software development just recently, but I have been a hobbyist for 4 years now. My skill set currently revolves around web development in Java, but I am currently studying other technologies such as Python and Ruby on Rails to widen my horizons. At the moment, I am really fond of Ruby on Rails, so I am probably going to build my upcoming projects in RoR.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, you got the impression that I am a really awesome programmer, you are wrong. To be honest, if you're considering to hire me to do freelance work, I cannot guarantee that I can live up to your expectations. I still have a long way to go when it comes to software development. Even then, I was still hired pretty easily at my current job because they thought I was really good. I don't know where they got that idea from. I'm trying my best not to disappoint them though.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, this site is supposed to be a way to sell myself to you, not incriminate myself. Why did I even tell you that? I am going to lose potential customers this way.</p>


<h3 id="services">What can I do for you?</h3>
<p>Here is a list of technologies that I am currently familiar with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Java (Spring, Maven and Hibernate)</li>
  <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>Python (Django and Pylons)</li>
  <li>.NET (C# and ASP.NET)</li>
  <li>PHP (Please don't give me PHP work)</li>
  <li>Android</li>
</ul>
<p>When I say familiar, I mean I have wasted enough time on studying to be able to make at least a simple application to say that I am aware of how the technology works. Afterwards, depending on the circumstances and how I like the technology, I either move on to the next one or focus more on the said technology. What I'm trying to say is that if you are going to hire me to do something for you, I am probably going to have a hard time getting the job done since I need to study the technologies involved first.</p>

<h3 id="portfolio">Are there any of my work I can show you?</h3>
<p>Nothing! Now move along. I'm just kidding. Most of the actual work I've done are under NDAs from their respective companies, so I can't actually show them to you.
